**What is this?**


Mysql query will become slow when table contains millions of rows. A simple way of solving this probolem is spliting the big table into small ones. We use some method to decide which table each row should be moved into. A widely used method is "modulus", e.g. group rows by [ID mod 100]. This tool will help you to do this job easily.
